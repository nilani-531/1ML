Gather a diverse dataset with health-related features.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess data for quality and consistency.
Normalize or standardize features.
Feature Selection:

Identify influential variables for accurate predictions.
Model Development:

Implement various machine learning algorithms for prediction.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
Cross-Validation:

Assess model performance and mitigate overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Model Interpretability (Optional):

Enhance model interpretability with techniques like SHAP values.
User Interface (Optional):

Develop a user-friendly interface for input and predictions.
Integration with EHR (Optional):

Explore integration with electronic health records.
Documentation (Optional):

Comprehensive documentation on methodology and usage.
Validation and Testing:

Conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy and robustness.
